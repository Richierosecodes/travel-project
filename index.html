                    <p>
                        Lagos or Lagos City is the most populous city in Nigeria as well as Africa, with an estimated population of 21 million in 2015. The estimated population for Lagos city was more than 24 million in 2022; and around 30 million for the Lagos metropolitan area, including the suburban area reaching far into the neighbouring Ogun State, thus making Lagos the most populous urban area in Africa.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Lagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century and Binis in the 16th century. The Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. Because the area was dominated by the then expansive Benin Empire, they called it Eko, from the late 16th century to the mid-19th century. The name Eko was given to it by Oba Ado, a prince from Benin Kingdom. Eko is still the native name for Lagos to date.
